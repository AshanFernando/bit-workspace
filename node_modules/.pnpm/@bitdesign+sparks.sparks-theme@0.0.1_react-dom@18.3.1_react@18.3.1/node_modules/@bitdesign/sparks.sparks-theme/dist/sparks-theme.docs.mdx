A theme component for using the SparksTheme Design Language and tokens.

## Get started

To use the theme in your app, install the theme and apply it on your component tree.
Themes are usually applied on the root of your component tree.

```tsx
export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <SparksTheme>
      <Homepage />
    </SparksTheme>
  );
}
```

### Compose the theme

You can compose your theme to create specific variations such as Dark or Light themes, overriding some or all of its properties. 
To compose your theme, create a new component and use the theme as following:

```tsx
const myTokenOverrides: WallyThemeSchema = {
  backgroundColor: 'black'
};

export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <WayneTheme overrides={myTokenOverrides}>
      <Homepage />
    </WayneTheme>
  );
}
```

## Create your own theme

If you are looking to build your own design system and add new design tokens and rules, you can fork the example theme component:

```
bit fork examples/wayne-theme my-theme --scope my.org-design
```

### Color palette

Color palette is auto-generated by the Material UI coloring algorithm. You can also manually set each of the color weights to your convenience. 

```tsx
export const WayneThemeProvider = createTheme<WayneThemeSchema>({
  palette: {
    primary: '#ffffff', // set just the origin color
    neutral: {
      origin: '#ffffff',
      100: '#cccccc'
    }
  },
});
```

You can set the origin color, or add as many specific weights as needed. You can find more information on [Color Palettes in its component](/).

### Fonts

Apply your fonts either by using local fonts or css imports. The example below shows using Google fonts:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;700&display=swap');
```

You can find more information on using fonts in the Bit docs.

### Spacing

You can use Sparks spacing strategy for spacing your components, by default it uses `8px` as the base unit for computing the spacing scale. You can modify the spacing configuration in your theme:

```tsx
export const WayneThemeProvider = createTheme<WayneThemeSchema>({
  spacing: {
    baseUnit: 4, // change the base unit to 4px
    segments: {
      // add a new spacing segment
      xl: {
        multiplier: 1.25,
        levels: 4
      }
    }
  }
});
```

You can learn more on the spacing scale in the [Spacing component](/).

### Tokens

You can add new design tokens to be available to your components by passing your design token loader to the `tokens` property:

```tsx
function loadTokens({ palette, spacing }: LoadTokensContext) {
  return {
    border: {
      color: palette.neutral.default,
      radius: spacing.default
    }
  };
}

export const WayneThemeProvider = createTheme<WayneThemeSchema>({
  tokens: loadTokens,
});
```
