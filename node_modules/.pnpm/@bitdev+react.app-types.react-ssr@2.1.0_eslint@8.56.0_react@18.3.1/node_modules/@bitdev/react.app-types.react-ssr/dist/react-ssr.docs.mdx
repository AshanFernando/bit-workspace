description: A webpack-esbuild React app type. Supports SSR.
---

A React SSR app type. 

Supports:
- CSS Support - Style your application with your favorite CSS tools, including support for CSS modules, with either sass or less.
- Asset and image optimization (SVG, PNG, JPEG)
- MDX support.

Our basic template uses [React Router](/) for routing and [GraphQL](/) for data fetching.

Use from your React env:

### Add to your env

```ts
class MyReactEnv extends ReactEnv {
  //...
  apps(): EnvHandler<AppTypeList> {
    return AppTypeList.from([
      // include this app type.
      ReactSsrType.from(),
    ]);
  }
}
```

## Create your first app component

```bash
bit fork bitdev.react/examples/react-ssr-app
```

## Run the app

```bash
# use `bit app list` to view all available applications in your workspace. 
bit run my-app
```

## Build the app

To build the app use:

```bash
bit build my-app
```

If using Ripple CI, simply snap and export your components.
Build artifacts can be found on the directory the `bit build` command will output.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets-manifest.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ static
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ css
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ main.508cd0a7.css
â”œâ”€â”€ server.cjs
â””â”€â”€ ssr.js
```

You can now use `node` to simply run your app:

```bash
node /path/to/output/server-runner.cjs 8080
```

You can now checkout your application running on https://localhost:8080. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Deploy the app

You can use one of the Bit deployers.

- Docker.
- Kubernetes.

If using Ripple CI, don't forget to set your tokens.
